## Focus
- Web scraping
- Natural Language Processing (Tokenize/Stem/Count-Vectorize/TFIDF) 
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Modelling with Random Forest/ Random Forest with Grid Search/ AdaBoost
- Confusion Matrix


## Requirements
Scrape and prepare your own data.

Create and compare at least two models for each section. One of the two models should be a decision tree or ensemble model. The other can be a classifier or regression of your choosing (e.g. Ridge, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc).

Section 1: Job Salary Trends
Section 2: Job Category Factors
Prepare a polished Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.

Make sure to clearly describe and label each section.
Comment on your code so that others could, in theory, replicate your work.
A brief writeup in an executive summary, written for a non-technical audience.

Writeups should be at least 500-1000 words, defining any technical terms, explaining your approach, as well as any risks and limitations.

## Suggestions for Getting Started
1. Collect data from Indeed.com (or another aggregator) on data-related jobs to use in predicting salary trends for your analysis.
 - Select and parse data from at least 1000 postings for jobs, potentially from multiple location searches.
 
2. Find out what factors most directly impact salaries (e.g. title, location, department, etc).
 - Test, validate, and describe your models. What factors predict salary category? How do your models perform?
 
3. Discover which features have the greatest importance when determining a low vs. high paying job.
 - Your Boss is interested in what overall features hold the greatest significance.
 - HR is interested in which SKILLS and KEY WORDS hold the greatest significance.
 
4. Author an executive summary that details the highlights of your analysis for a non-technical audience.

5. If tackling the bonus question, try framing the salary problem as a classification problem detecting low vs. high salary positions.
