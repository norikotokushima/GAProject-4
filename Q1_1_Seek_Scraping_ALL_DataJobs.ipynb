    "1. Scrape and prepare your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create and compare at least two models for each section. One of the two models should be a decision tree or ensemble model. The other can be a classifier or regression of your choosing (e.g. Ridge, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Section 1: Job Salary Trends\n",
    " - Section 2: Job Category Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prepare a polished Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Make sure to clearly describe and label each section.\n",
    " - Comment on your code so that others could, in theory, replicate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A brief writeup in an executive summary, written for a non-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Writeups should be at least 500-1000 words, defining any technical terms, explaining your approach, as well as any risks and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## BONUS\n",
    "5. Answer the salary discussion by using your model to explain the tradeoffs between detecting high vs low salary positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Convert your executive summary into a public blog post of at least 500 words, in which you document your approach in a tutorial for other aspiring data scientists. Link to this in your notebook."

    "## Suggestions for Getting Started\n",
    "1. Collect data from Indeed.com (or another aggregator) on data-related jobs to use in predicting salary trends for your analysis.\n",
    " - Select and parse data from at least 1000 postings for jobs, potentially from multiple location searches.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Find out what factors most directly impact salaries (e.g. title, location, department, etc).\n",
    " - Test, validate, and describe your models. What factors predict salary category? How do your models perform?\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Discover which features have the greatest importance when determining a low vs. high paying job.\n",
    " - Your Boss is interested in what overall features hold the greatest significance.\n",
    " - HR is interested in which SKILLS and KEY WORDS hold the greatest significance.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Author an executive summary that details the highlights of your analysis for a non-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If tackling the bonus question, try framing the salary problem as a classification problem detecting low vs. high salary positions."

    "# QUESTION 1: Factors that impact salary\n",
    "To predict salary you will be building either a classification or regression model, using features like the location, title, and summary of the job. If framing this as a regression problem, you will be estimating the listed salary amounts. You may instead choose to frame this as a classification problem, in which case you will create labels from these salaries (high vs. low salary, for example) according to thresholds (such as median salary).\n",

    "- Unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, clustering)\n",
    "- Ensemble methods and decision tree models\n",
    "- SVM models\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you decide to use, the most important thing is to justify your choices and interpret your results. Communication of your process is key. Note that most listings DO NOT come with salary information. You'll need to able to extrapolate or predict the expected salaries for these listings."

    "# QUESTION 2: Factors that distinguish job category\n",
    "Using the job postings you scraped for part 1 (or potentially new job postings from a second round of scraping), identify features in the data related to job postings that can distinguish job titles from each other. There are a variety of interesting ways you can frame the target variable, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What components of a job posting distinguish data scientists from other data jobs?\n",
    "- What features are important for distinguishing junior vs. senior positions?\n",
    "- Do the requirements for titles vary significantly with industry (e.g. healthcare vs. government)?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may end up making multiple classification models to tackle different questions. Be sure to clearly explain your hypotheses and framing, any feature engineering, and what your target variables are. The type of classification model you choose is up to you. Be sure to interpret your results and evaluate your models' performance."
